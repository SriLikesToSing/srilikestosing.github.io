title: Proof of Work based off of Rubik's Cubes
---

<Disclaimer: This PoF method might not be necessarily better but it is another proof of work method lmao.

Hello everyone, I had a lot of free time on my hands as 11th grade comes to a close. I was always obsessed with how proof of work could somehow create this sort of "consensus" among a large user base and I was trying to invent different new proof of work methods that were weird and unique that may turn out to be viable. I realized that rubiks cubes might work in creating a PoF that would be hard and scalable if we ran out of different combinations for the base 3x3 rubik's cube. (will talk about this later in the post). So here's my proposed proof of work. There are 43,000,000,000,000,000,000 possible states on a rubik's cube. The goal of this proof of work is to show the transition (or exact sequence of moves) between one state and another state composed in rubik's cube notation (https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/notation/). Finding this is hard and I do not know at the moment (maybe im ignorant) if there is a proposed algorithm for this haha. The resulting sequences of moves would be the PoF you would show to the chain to validate the block. If we ever run out of scrambles we have the possibility of scaling up. For example, if we run out of all the 43 quintillion states that the 3x3 rubik's cube has we can easily upgrade to the 4x4 rubik's cube and so on for any nxn. Computers can easily simulate an nxn rubik's cube. Making a program that outputs the sequences of moves to one state to the next will be really difficult as you get to higher nxn cubes. Another cool aspect of this proof of work is that for funs sake you can imagine a pool of people trying to "mine" the solution by twisting and turning the cubes arbitrarily and it made me laugh hysterically thinking about that comical scenario. Anyhow, this blog post is just me toying around and having fun in my free time with weird abstractions and ideas. Hope you guys enjoyed this post I hope people dont take this super seriously as I dont know if this can be implemented wide scale. I might actually make a cryptocurrency with this proof of work mechanism so stay tuned!

Thanks for reading.
